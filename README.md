# Candy-Crush-Js
This is a candy crush game. Had help with Ania Kubow's tutorial. Learnt a lot about for loops and includes property.

# Logic
The logic in the code is simple and complex at the same time. 

# Steps
First we start out by creating div elements of 8 * 8 which is 63 divs.
We give them sizes and using for loop to start out issueing candies to every div.
We then set Attributes for every div element
We issue drag - drop properties to every candy

Will continue when I'm done........
